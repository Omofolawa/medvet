# Medvet: GMP Compliant QC Operation System
The project is a **Quality Control (QC) Release System** for a sterile manufacturing environment. The system handles user authentication, data transcription, batch processing, and QC tests to ensure compliance with both ALCOA principles and Annex 1 of EudraLex guidelines.

## Stakeholder User Stories:

### 1. User Account Management
- As a QC Analyst, I need to securely log into the system so that I can enter QC test results.
- As an Administrator, I need to create, manage, and authenticate user accounts securely.
  
### 2. QC Test Entry
- As a QC Analyst, I need to enter and save QC test results for each batch, so that the batch can be assessed for compliance.

### 3. Batch Approval
- As a QA Manager, I need to ensure all QC test results for a batch comply with regulatory standards before I can approve the batch for release.

### 4. Data Integrity and Audit Log
- **As a Regulatory Inspector, I need an audit trail of user activities, so that I can verify the integrity of the QC test results and user actions.
